# Pay Gap Prophet

An ML-powered platform that analyzes 60 years of gender wage gap data to predict future trends and identify policies that actually work.

## The Problem

Women won't see equal pay until 2056 at the current rate. But some countries like Colombia (0.33% gap) and Iceland closed their gaps in just 10 years. What did they do differently?

## The Solution

Pay Gap Prophet shows governments and activists which policies close wage gaps by learning from countries that already succeeded.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive dashboard comparing 50+ countries
- ML predictions extending to 2039
- Identify policy leaders (Iceland, Colombia, Luxembourg)
- See which interventions actually worked

## Tech Stack

# The Tech Stack
**Frontend:**
- Next.js with React
- Recharts for visualizations

**Backend:**
- Python Flask API
- Pandas for data processing
- Scikit-learn for ML (linear regression models)

**Data:**
- 60 years of OECD wage gap statistics (1960-2024)
- 3,500+ data points across 50+ countries

## How It Works

1. **Historical Analysis:** Process 60+ years of OECD data
2. **ML Training:** Train linear regression models on historical trends
3. **Predictions:** Predict wage gaps through 2039
4. **Policy Identification:** Highlight what worked in successful countries

## Key Insights

- **Colombia:** 0.33% gap using pay certification + education investment
- **Iceland:** 0.9% annual reduction via mandatory equal pay laws
- **Canada:** Barely improving (12.6% → 10.4% by 2039)
- **Global:** Average dropping from 13.5% to 7.8% by 2039

## Impact

**For Governments:** Skip decades of guessing—see what works

**For Activists:** Proof to demand change

**For Women:** Millions earning fair wages faster
